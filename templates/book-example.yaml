  A magical forest clearing at dusk. In the center, a young child stands on a moss-covered
  stone, reaching up toward a glowing butterfly that hovers just above their fingertips. The
  child's face is tilted upward, eyes wide with wonder, mouth slightly open in awe. Behind
  them, a massive waterfall cascades down between ancient trees, its mist catching the last
  rays of golden sunlight. The forest floor is carpeted with luminescent mushrooms that pulse
  with soft blue and green light. Small magical creatures peek out from behind tree trunks -
  a rabbit with antlers, a tiny dragon perched on a branch, a fox with shimmering fur. Ferns
  and wildflowers frame the bottom of the scene. The waterfall's mist creates a soft, ethereal
  atmosphere throughout.

back_cover_visual: |
  A winding forest path disappearing into misty depths. The path is made of smooth river
  stones, partially covered with moss and small flowers. On either side, tall trees arch
  overhead, their branches intertwining to form a natural tunnel. Magical lights float along
  the path like lanterns, casting warm golden glows. In the mid-ground, a small wooden bridge
  crosses over a babbling stream where small fish with iridescent scales can be seen jumping.
  The background fades into soft purple and blue mist, suggesting mystery and adventure ahead.
  Mushrooms of various sizes line the path edges, some as tall as tree stumps, glowing faintly.
  Fireflies dance in the air between the trees. The overall feeling is one of invitation and
  peaceful mystery.
