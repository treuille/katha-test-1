beat: "Attempt #1 (simple/obvious)"

# This is what "hooks them" into the next pages
# Initially, copy this from `templates/story-template.yaml` for this spread
hook: Simple solutions fail, prompting the question of who might have better answers.

# This is the payoff from the previous spread's hook
# Initially, copy this from `templates/story-template.yaml` for this spread
payoff: A wise helper appears who offers new perspective or guidance.

# This is a short (1-2 sentences) which describes what you see on the page.

# This what you see in the story
# The visual description can be very long and detailed to convey the scene
# IMPORTANT: Describe a SINGLE INSTANT IN TIME - not a sequence of actions
# - Describe WHAT is happening at this exact moment (the action, poses, expressions)
# - Describe WHERE things are (positions, spatial relationships, background details)
# - Include specific visual details about the world, objects, and environment
# - Do NOT include stylistic suggestions (those come from world.yaml)
# - Do NOT describe multiple moments or a sequence of events
visual: |
  Cullan is mid-slip, falling backwards off a wooden ladder. His body is angled
  diagonally, arms spread wide, eyes wide with surprise, mouth open. The ladder
  is propped against a massive oak tree, its rungs slick with moisture. Below
  him on the mossy ground lie scattered tools: a coil of rope, a small hammer,
  and a leather pouch. The forest surrounds them - tall trees with thick trunks,
  dense undergrowth of ferns, and a small stream visible in the mid-ground. Morning
  light filters through the canopy creating dappled shadows on the forest floor.
  Mushrooms grow at the base of nearby trees.

# This what the text says on the page
# IMPORTANT: Keep text to 2 sentences maximum. Be concise.
