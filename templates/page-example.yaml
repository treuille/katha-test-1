# This what you see in the story
# The visual description can be very long and detailed to convey the scene
visual: |
  Cullan is shown slipping off the ladder, with a look of surprise on his face.
  The ladder is propped against a tall tree, its rungs glistening with morning dew.
  In the background, we can see the forest clearing where this takes place, with
  shafts of golden sunlight filtering through the canopy above. Cullan's arms are
  windmilling as he tries to regain his balance, his tools scattered below him.
  His expression captures that exact moment of realization when a simple plan
  goes awry - eyes wide, mouth forming an "O" of surprise. The composition uses
  a dynamic diagonal to emphasize the motion and precariousness of the moment.

# This what the text says on the page
# IMPORTANT: Keep text to 2 sentences maximum. Be concise.

  Cullan stepped onto the ladder, but found that it was too slippery to climb.
