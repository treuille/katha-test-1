# Generated Images Folder

This is where generated images are stored.

Images are generated using `scripts/gen_image.py` and follow this naming convention:

- `cu-01-openai.jpg`: Cullan's first page generated with OpenAI DALL-E 3
- `cu-01-replicate.jpg`: Cullan's first page generated with Replicate SDXL
- `em-05-ideogram.jpg`: Emer's fifth page generated with Ideogram v3, etc.

To learn how to generate images, see [docs/image-generation.md](../docs/image-generation.md).

To understand the two-letter character codes, see the [README.md](../README.md).

**Note**: Generated images are not committed to the repository (git-ignored). Each user generates their own images using their API keys.
