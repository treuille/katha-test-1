# Visual description that works from both character perspectives
visual: |
  A peaceful forest clearing bathed in warm afternoon sunlight. Thirteen-year-old
  Cullan sits on soft moss, his bouncy blonde hair catching the light, his piercing
  blue eyes gentle and watchful. His lanky frame is relaxed but attentive. Before
  him, one-year-old Hansel sits surrounded by colorful geometric objects - cubes,
  spheres, pyramids - each one catching his delighted attention. Hansel's face
  radiates pure joy, his signature smile bright as he reaches for a bright blue
  cube. The scene captures a moment of quiet protection and innocent wonder,
  with dappled shadows dancing across them both.

  The clearing was quiet except for Hansel's delighted giggles. Cullan watched
  his little cousin discover each geometric shape with fresh wonder - the way
  Hansel's eyes lit up when he picked up the blue cube, how he laughed when
  the yellow sphere rolled away.

  "You're really something, little guy," Cullan said softly, his shy smile
  appearing as Hansel looked up at him with that constant, easy grin. In this
  moment, Cullan felt the protective warmth he always wanted to share - to be
  the gentle guardian, to watch over someone who saw the world with such pure joy.

  Hansel reached toward Cullan, offering him a red pyramid. And Cullan, taking
  it carefully, knew this was just the beginning of their adventures together.
