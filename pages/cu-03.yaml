description: Cullan tries to find a way across a wide stream to photograph a rare glowing mushroom on the other side, but the obvious stepping stones prove unstable.

# Visual description for the illustrator
visual: |
  Cullan stands at the edge of a wide, fast-flowing stream in the Hidden Forest, his camera
  hanging around his neck. Across the water, on the far bank, a cluster of luminescent
  mushrooms glow with an ethereal blue-green light that seems to pulse gently. The mushrooms
  are exactly what Cullan has been searching for—the perfect subject for his photography.
  In the foreground, Cullan has one foot tentatively placed on what appeared to be a stable
  stepping stone, but it's wobbling dangerously beneath him. His arms are outstretched for
  balance, his blue eyes wide with concentration and a hint of frustration. Several other
  moss-covered stones dot the stream, but they're either too far apart or visibly slick with
  water. The stream rushes between them, white foam suggesting the current's strength. Behind
  Cullan, the forest is dense with detail—tiny birds watching from branches, beetles on bark,
  and the dappled afternoon light filtering through the canopy. His blonde hair is slightly
  windswept, and his expression captures that moment of realization that the simple path won't
  work. The composition emphasizes the distance between Cullan and his goal, with the glowing
  mushrooms drawing the eye across the challenging water.

  Cullan spotted the glowing mushrooms across the stream—the perfect photograph—but
  the stepping stones were too slippery and unstable to cross. He stepped back from
  the wobbling stone, frowning in thought.
