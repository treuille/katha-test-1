  The rain has stopped and the sun has broken through the clouds in spectacular
  fashion, creating multiple rainbows across the forest. Emer stands in a beautiful
  clearing - perhaps the same magical convergence point from earlier, but now filled
  with sunshine and fresh rain-washed light. She has her painting supplies spread
  around her, but she's not just painting on paper anymore. She's creating everywhere:
  painting designs on wet stones, arranging flowers in patterns, building with
  Hansel's colorful blocks, dancing, singing - pure creative expression in every
  direction. Hansel is fully involved, laughing and creating alongside her. The scene
  is an explosion of joyful creativity. We can see the hesitation in Emer's posture
  from just a moment before - a slight pause, a moment of wondering if this will work
  - but then the full commitment to creating anyway. And around them, the sparkles are
  appearing in greater numbers, drawn irresistibly to this pure creative joy. They're
  not just a few anymore, but dozens, hundreds, swirling and dancing. The forest
  creatures have all emerged - the wise bear watching from nearby, deer and rabbits
  gathering at the edges, birds in every tree. Everything is rendered in extraordinary
  detail - every flower, every sparkle, every expression of joy.

  Emer took a deep breath and made her choice: she would create beauty because it
  made her happy, whether the sparkles came or not. And as she painted and danced and
  played with pure joy, magic filled the air.
