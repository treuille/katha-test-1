description: Hansel's simple joy in the rain reminds Emer what matters - she chooses to keep trying not because she has to, but because creating beauty brings joy.

  The rain is still falling, but something has shifted. Hansel has gotten up and is
  playing in the rain, jumping in puddles with pure delight, his characteristic big
  smile returned. Water splashes up around his feet in crystalline droplets. Despite
  everything, despite the long journey and the disappointment, he's finding joy in
  this moment. Emer watches him, and we can see her expression transforming - from
  sadness to a small smile, from defeat to remembering something important. Near
  Hansel's feet, barely visible at first but there if you look closely, a single
  rainbow sparkle has appeared, drawn to his pure joy. The forest around them is
  still rain-soaked and detailed, but the light is beginning to change - the first
  hints of sunshine breaking through the clouds, creating actual rainbows in the
  mist. Emer stands up, setting aside her ruined painting, and we can see the
  decision forming in her posture - she's choosing to keep going. The composition
  shows the contrast between Hansel's unthinking joy and Emer's more conscious choice
  to rediscover that feeling. Everything is rendered in careful detail - the rain,
  the light, the emerging rainbow, Hansel's pure happiness, and Emer's dawning
  realization.

  Watching Hansel splash and giggle in the rain, Emer felt something shift inside her.
  She couldn't force the sparkles to appear, but she could choose to create and play
  anyway, just because it made her heart light.
