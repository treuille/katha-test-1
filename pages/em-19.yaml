  The magical forest has darkened. Rain begins to fall in soft, melancholy sheets,
  creating a veil of water between the trees. The light has shifted from magical and
  bright to gray and somber. Emer sits hunched on a large root beneath an overhang,
  trying to stay dry. Her curly blonde hair is damp, her painting supplies are getting
  wet despite her efforts to protect them, and her expression shows genuine sadness
  and exhaustion. Hansel sits close to her, looking worried - his usual smile gone,
  replaced by concern for his sister. The forest around them, though still detailed,
  feels heavier and more oppressive. The water that was magical before now just feels
  wet and cold. Flowers droop. The creatures that watched before have hidden away
  from the rain. Even the moss and stones look darker and less inviting. Everything
  in the composition emphasizes the weight of disappointment and tiredness - Emer's
  slumped posture, the gray palette of the rain, the sense of being far from home
  and comfort. This is rendered with the same careful detail as previous pages, but
  the emotional tone is completely different - showing that even magical places can
  feel hard when you're discouraged.

  Rain began to fall, cold and steady, as if the forest itself felt sad. Emer hugged
  her knees and wondered if she'd made a mistake - maybe she should have just stayed
  in her familiar clearing where everything felt safe.
