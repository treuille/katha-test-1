visual: |
  A peaceful forest clearing bathed in warm afternoon sunlight. Thirteen-year-old
  Cullan approaches and sits on soft moss, his bouncy blonde hair catching the light,
  his piercing blue eyes gentle and watchful. His lanky frame is relaxed but attentive.
  Before him, one-year-old Hansel sits surrounded by colorful geometric objects—cubes,
  spheres, pyramids—each one catching his delighted attention. Hansel's face radiates
  pure joy, his signature smile bright as he reaches for a bright blue cube. The scene
  captures a moment of quiet protection and innocent wonder, with dappled shadows
  dancing across them both.

# Story text that works whether read from Cullan's book or Hansel's book
text: |
  Cullan followed the giggling through the trees and found Hansel playing with
  geometric shapes in the clearing. Hansel offered him a red pyramid, and Cullan
  sat down beside him with a smile.
