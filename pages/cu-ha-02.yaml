# Visual description that works from both character perspectives
visual: |
  A dramatic forest scene where a crystal-clear stream rushes over smooth rocks, creating
  small rapids and foam. One-year-old Hansel stands atop a large moss-covered boulder in
  the middle of the current, his eyes wide and frightened, one hand reaching toward the
  beautiful butterfly that hovers just beyond his grasp above the water. His other hand
  clutches his blue pyramid toy tight against his chest. The boulder is too tall for him
  to climb down safely - the water swirls fast below. His characteristic smile is gone,
  replaced with scared uncertainty as he teeters near the edge. Thirteen-year-old Cullan
  appears on the bank, his camera swinging from his neck as he moves urgently but carefully.
  His piercing blue eyes show both concern and determination. Without hesitation, Cullan
  steps onto the slippery rocks, arms out for balance, water splashing around his shoes.
  He reaches up to Hansel with gentle, reassuring hands. The moment Cullan lifts him down
  to safety, Hansel's bright smile floods back. They stand together in the shallow water
  near the bank - Cullan protective and relieved, Hansel clinging to his cousin with one
  hand while the other points excitedly at the butterfly, which now rests on a nearby
  flower as if it had been waiting for them all along.

# Story text that works whether read from Cullan's book or Hansel's book
text: |
  Cullan heard frightened crying from the stream - there was little Hansel, stuck on a
  boulder reaching for a butterfly! Cullan carefully climbed across the slippery rocks
  and lifted him down to safety. The moment Hansel was safe in his cousin's arms, his
  big smile returned - and he pointed excitedly as the butterfly danced deeper into the woods.
