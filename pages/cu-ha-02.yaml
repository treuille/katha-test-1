visual: |
  A sun-dappled forest clearing where the garden ends and the wild woods begin.
  Thirteen-year-old Cullan emerges from the tree line, his camera hanging around his
  neck, bouncy blonde hair catching the afternoon light. His piercing blue eyes widen
  with gentle surprise as he spots one-year-old Hansel sitting on the soft moss.
  Hansel is surrounded by objects he's found - pinecones, smooth stones, interesting
  twigs arranged like his geometric toys at home. He still clutches the blue pyramid
  he brought from his room. His signature bright smile radiates pure joy as he looks
  up at his cousin and offers him a pinecone. The beautiful butterfly that led Hansel
  here rests on a nearby flower, its wings shimmering. Cullan kneels down with a
  protective, loving smile, but even as they share this moment, the butterfly begins
  to flutter deeper into the forest, catching Hansel's eye.

# Story text that works whether read from Cullan's book or Hansel's book
text: |
  Cullan was exploring the forest with his camera when he heard familiar giggling.
  There was Hansel, who had wandered out following a butterfly! The little one offered
  Cullan a pinecone with his biggest smile. Cullan ruffled his hair gently - but then
  the butterfly danced away deeper into the woods, and Hansel toddle-ran after it again.
