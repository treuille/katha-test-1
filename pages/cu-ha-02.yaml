visual: |
  A peaceful forest clearing bathed in warm afternoon sunlight. Thirteen-year-old
  Cullan approaches and sits on soft moss, his bouncy blonde hair catching the light,
  his piercing blue eyes gentle and watchful. His lanky frame is relaxed but attentive.
  Before him, one-year-old Hansel sits surrounded by colorful geometric objects—cubes,
  spheres, pyramids—each one catching his delighted attention. Hansel's face radiates
  pure joy, his signature smile bright as he reaches for a bright blue cube. The scene
  captures a moment of quiet protection and innocent wonder, with dappled shadows
  dancing across them both.

  Cullan heard the giggling before he saw anything. Following the sound through
  the trees, he stepped into the clearing and stopped. There was Hansel, his little
  cousin, surrounded by colorful geometric shapes, laughing with pure delight.

  "Hansel?" Cullan said softly, setting down his camera and moving closer. The
  toddler looked up with that constant, easy grin, and Cullan felt his heart warm.

  "You're really something, little guy," Cullan said, sitting down on the moss
  beside him. Hansel's eyes lit up as he picked up the blue cube, then laughed
  when the yellow sphere rolled away.

  Hansel reached toward Cullan, offering him a red pyramid. And Cullan, taking
  it carefully, knew this was just the beginning of their adventures together.
