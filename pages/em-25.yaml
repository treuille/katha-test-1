  In the magical clearing, now peaceful after the spectacular display of sparkles,
  the wise ancient bear approaches Emer. The bear holds out her large paw, and in it
  rests a beautiful crystal - about the size of a large marble, perfectly clear, but
  with tiny rainbow sparkles somehow suspended inside it, dancing and swirling in
  their own miniature universe. The crystal catches the light in extraordinary ways,
  creating small rainbows. Emer kneels to receive it with both hands, her expression
  showing wonder and gratitude. Hansel stands close beside her, watching with his
  characteristic big smile. The bear's expression is warm and knowing - a grandmother
  passing on something precious. Around them, the forest is returning to normal but
  still holds traces of magic - a few sparkles still float in the air, the water
  still flows in beautiful patterns, everything is still rendered in loving detail.
  Other forest creatures gather to witness this moment of closure - deer, rabbits,
  birds, mice, even the tricky raccoon in the background looking somewhat humbled.
  The light suggests late afternoon, time beginning the transition toward home.

  The ancient bear held out a crystal that sparkled with trapped rainbow light. "Keep
  this," she said gently, "to remember: you carry the magic inside you, wherever you go."
