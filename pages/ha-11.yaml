  Pure joy in the magical garden. One-year-old Hansel sits surrounded by flowers
  and butterflies, his characteristic bright smile radiant with happiness. He's
  playing a familiar game - arranging flowers into geometric patterns just like
  his toys at home - spherical dandelions, pyramid-shaped blooms, cube-like buds.
  Butterflies land gently on his hands, shoulders, and hair. The butterfly he
  followed all this way rests contentedly on his palm, its iridescent wings
  catching the light. As the afternoon sun begins to lower, casting long golden
  rays, the butterfly seems to make a choice - it nestles into Hansel's gentle
  hand as if saying "I'll come with you." The garden path back toward home is
  visible in the distance, now familiar rather than frightening. The external
  quest is complete - he found the butterfly's home and made a magical friend.

  Hansel danced and played with all the butterflies in their beautiful garden. When
  it was time to go home, his special butterfly friend landed on his hand and came
  along too!
