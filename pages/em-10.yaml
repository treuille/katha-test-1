  Emer has noticed the sparkles and her expression shows the moment of understanding
  dawning. She's looking at them with wonder but also with a new awareness - seeing
  the connection between their happy play and the appearance of the magical lights.
  The sparkles dance all around her and Hansel, more numerous now, swirling in
  beautiful patterns. Hansel looks up too, clapping his hands with delight at the
  pretty lights, which makes even more sparkles appear. The composition shows the
  children surrounded by a constellation of rainbow sparkles, each one rendered in
  luminous detail. Emer's paintings and Hansel's block tower are visible, and
  sparkles hover above each creation. The forest around them seems to glow with
  approval - flowers bloom brighter, water sparkles more, even the moss seems more
  vibrant. Forest creatures have gathered closer to watch this magical moment. The
  light is beautiful and warm, and Emer's expression shows she's beginning to
  understand something important: the sparkles weren't something to chase, but
  something that appears when you're truly happy and creative.

  When Emer looked up and saw the sparkles swirling around them, she understood -
  they appeared when she and Hansel were creating and playing with pure joy, not
  when she was desperately searching.
