  Emer is mid-twirl in a small clearing, arms outstretched and her curly blonde hair
  flying as she spins and dances. Her movements are joyful and energetic, trying to
  recreate the magical feeling from when the sparkles first appeared. Hansel toddles
  around her in a circle, giggling and trying to copy her dance moves with his
  characteristic enthusiasm. The forest is alive with detail - every flower, every
  fern, every piece of bark lovingly rendered. A small audience of forest creatures
  has gathered: rabbits, birds, mice, even a young deer in the background, all
  watching the children with interest. But despite the beauty and joy of the moment,
  there are no magical sparkles. The light is beginning to shift toward late afternoon,
  suggesting time is passing. Emer's expression shows she's running out of ideas,
  pausing mid-dance to look around hopefully, then with growing uncertainty. The
  composition captures both the sweetness of childlike problem-solving and the moment
  of realizing she needs help.

  Emer danced and sang her favorite songs, hoping the sparkles loved music as much
  as she did. When they still didn't appear, she stopped and wondered: who in the
  Hidden Forest might know their secret?
