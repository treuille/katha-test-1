  Emer has noticed the sparkles and her expression shows the moment of understanding
  dawning. She's looking at them with wonder but also with a new awareness - seeing
  the connection between her happy creative play and the appearance of the magical
  lights. The sparkles dance all around her, more numerous now, swirling in beautiful
  patterns. She lifts her hands with delight at the pretty lights, and even more
  sparkles appear in response to her joy. The composition shows her surrounded by a
  constellation of rainbow sparkles, each one rendered in luminous detail. Her
  paintings are scattered around her, and sparkles hover above each creation. The
  forest around her seems to glow with approval - flowers bloom brighter, water
  sparkles more, even the moss seems more vibrant. Forest creatures have gathered
  closer to watch this magical moment. The light is beautiful and warm, and Emer's
  expression shows she's beginning to understand something important: the sparkles
  weren't something to chase, but something that appears when you're truly happy and
  creative.

  When Emer looked up and saw the sparkles swirling around her, she understood - they
  appeared when she was creating and playing with pure joy, not when she was
  desperately searching.
