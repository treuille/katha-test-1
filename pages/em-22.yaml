  Emer has joined Hansel in the rain, and she's started to paint again - but this
  time not to capture the sparkles or accomplish a goal, just for the pure joy of
  creating. She's painting on a new piece of paper, using the rain itself as part of
  her art, letting watercolors blend and flow in the raindrops. Her expression shows
  pure concentration and happiness - the look of someone doing what they love. Hansel
  dances nearby, still joyful. And around them, emerging from the air like magic,
  rainbow sparkles are beginning to appear. Not many yet, just a few, but growing -
  drawn to the genuine creative joy. In the background of the composition, almost
  like a memory panel, we can see a tiny echo of the very first page - Emer painting
  in her clearing when the sparkles first appeared. The visual connection makes it
  clear: this is the same energy, the same joy, the same creative spark. The rain is
  clearing, the sun breaking through in golden beams, and everything is shifting from
  gray to color. The forest watches approvingly - the bear visible in the distant
  background, birds and creatures emerging from their hiding places. Every detail is
  lovingly rendered, showing the transformation from despair to rediscovered purpose.

  As Emer painted just for the joy of it, letting the rain mix with her colors, she
  suddenly understood: the sparkles had appeared the very first time she was creating
  freely, with no goal but happiness.
