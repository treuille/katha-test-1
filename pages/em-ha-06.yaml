description: Emer realizes that Hansel is smiling and pointing at certain branches - the ones with moss growing on them. She notices these sturdy branches form a path following the stream.

  A moment of discovery and connection between the siblings. Emer sits on a
  broad, safe branch, watching Hansel intently. Hansel points excitedly at
  moss-covered branches ahead, his characteristic huge smile lighting up his
  face. Emer's expression shifts from tired to illuminated with realization -
  she sees the pattern now. The composition shows multiple moss-covered branches
  forming a clear pathway through the canopy, all sturdy and safe, all following
  the stream's glow below. The moss has its own soft green luminescence that
  echoes the stream. In the background, we can see the failed paths they tried
  before - bare, thin branches - in contrast to this new possibility.

  Emer was tired and unsure, but then she noticed Hansel was pointing and smiling
  at certain branches - the ones covered in soft, glowing moss. "Hansel, you're
  right!" The mossy branches were thick and strong, and they seemed to follow
  the stream's path perfectly. "Good job, little brother!"
