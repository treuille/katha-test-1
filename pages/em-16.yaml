  Emer walks with purpose through the strange forest, Hansel's hand in hers, no longer
  looking lost or uncertain. She's navigating by the pattern she discovered - moving
  from one bright gathering place to the next. The illustration shows her path as a
  visual journey through increasingly beautiful and magical spots: a place where three
  streams converge and flow upward, a grove where crystal-like flowers bloom in a
  perfect circle, a moss-covered stone where tiny waterfalls cascade in rainbow
  colors. Each location is rendered in exquisite detail - every flower petal, every
  water droplet, every piece of glowing moss. The forest creatures - rabbits, birds,
  a young deer, mice - watch approvingly from various vantage points, as if
  recognizing that she's finally on the right path. The light is growing stronger and
  more magical as she progresses, shifting from the strange purple-blue to a warmer,
  more radiant quality. Emer's expression shows confidence and excitement, the
  determination of someone who has figured something out for herself. Hansel looks
  up at her with trust and his characteristic big smile.

  Emer didn't need the raccoon or anyone else to tell her where to go. Following her
  own eyes and heart, she led Hansel from one bright gathering place to the next,
  each one more beautiful than the last.
