  The same cozy, sunlit corner where Hansel's story began - but everything feels
  different now. One-year-old Hansel sits on his soft rug with his geometric toys
  scattered around him just like before, but now his special butterfly friend
  perches nearby on a colorful sphere, watching him play. Hansel's smile is as
  bright as ever, but there's a new confidence in how he stacks his blocks - higher
  and bolder than before. Through the window, the same golden light streams in,
  but now it carries the promise of future adventures rather than mere curiosity.
  His mum appears in the doorway, smiling at her handsome little boy and his
  beautiful new friend. The butterfly's wings catch the light, casting tiny rainbow
  reflections across Hansel's toys. This is home - safe, familiar, beloved - but
  Hansel carries the forest's magic with him now. The ordinary world, transformed
  by wonder.
