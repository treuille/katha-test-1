description: The raccoon insists they must dive into a mysterious pool to find the sparkles, but Emer isn't sure whether to believe him.

visual: |
  The raccoon leads Emer and Hansel to a deep, dark pool of water that reflects
  strange colors - purples, greens, and silvers that shift and swirl like oil on
  water. The pool sits in a hollow between massive tree roots, surrounded by glowing
  mushrooms and unusual crystalline rocks. The raccoon gestures enthusiastically at
  the water, pointing downward with exaggerated certainty. Emer kneels at the pool's
  edge, peering into its mysterious depths where odd shadows move. Her expression
  shows clear skepticism - her eyebrows raised, lips pressed together in doubt.
  Hansel clutches his blocks tightly, staying well back from the water's edge, his
  usual smile replaced with uncertainty. The forest around them continues to be
  strange and wild, with water flowing in impossible directions and creatures
  watching from every shadow. The raccoon's reflection in the pool looks somehow even
  more untrustworthy than the raccoon himself. The light is beginning to shift,
  suggesting time is passing and adding subtle pressure to make a decision. Every
  detail is lovingly rendered - the texture of the moss, the shimmer on the water,
  the peculiar geometry of the rocks.

  "Just dive right in!" the raccoon insisted, his bottle caps jingling. "The sparkles
  are definitely at the bottom!" Emer looked at the mysterious pool, then at Hansel's
  worried face, and hesitated.
