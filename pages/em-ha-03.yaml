visual: |
  A comically frustrating scene where Emer and Hansel face a dense wall of
  thorny vines and twisted branches blocking their path. The glowing stream
  disappears into the impenetrable thicket. Hansel is partway into the thorns,
  his little arms reaching forward but unable to go further, still smiling
  despite the predicament. Emer is pulling him back gently, her face showing
  determination mixed with concern. Her curly hair has a few leaves caught in
  it. Behind them, the stream continues to glow invitingly, but the direct
  path is clearly impossible. The composition emphasizes the contrast between
  the open, beautiful forest behind them and the impenetrable barrier ahead.

  "We can just walk along the stream!" Emer said confidently. But the stream
  led straight into a thick tangle of thorns and vines. Hansel tried to crawl
  through, but Emer quickly pulled him back. "Oops! That won't work," she said.
  "There must be another way."
