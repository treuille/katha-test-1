  A moment of pure magic. Emer and Hansel are surrounded by a galaxy of rainbow
  sparkles - thousands of them, swirling in beautiful patterns around and above the
  children like a aurora borealis made of joy. The sparkles are rendered in luminous
  detail, each one shifting through the spectrum of rainbow colors. Emer stands with
  her arms outstretched, her face tilted up toward the lights, her expression showing
  complete understanding and happiness. She's not trying to catch them or control
  them - just experiencing them. Hansel claps and laughs, dancing in the sparkling
  light. The forest clearing is transformed into something transcendent, with the
  water from multiple streams catching and reflecting the sparkle-light, creating
  layers of rainbows and shimmer. The wise bear sits at the edge of the clearing,
  nodding with approval. All the forest creatures watch in wonder. Emer's artwork
  is scattered around - paintings, arranged flowers, patterns in stones - and each
  piece of art has its own small constellation of sparkles hovering above it. The
  composition shows the completion of the journey: Emer sought the sparkles by
  chasing them, and found them by simply being herself. Everything is rendered with
  the extraordinary detail that has marked the entire journey, but now suffused with
  light and joy.

  Sparkles filled the air like stars, dancing around every creation, every laugh,
  every moment of pure joy. Emer finally understood: they weren't something to find -
  they appeared whenever she created from her heart.
