  The forest has grown darker and more ominous. One-year-old Hansel sits on the
  forest floor, his usual bright smile replaced with uncertainty and fatigue. His
  small shoulders slump, and for the first time he looks truly tired. The butterfly
  he's been following is now just a distant shimmer among the darkening trees,
  barely visible. Storm clouds gather overhead, and the cheerful afternoon light
  has faded to gray twilight. His geometric toys from home are nowhere to be seen -
  he's truly far from the familiar. A few scattered flower petals lie around him,
  remnants of the bright path he'd been following. His little hand reaches toward
  the distant butterfly but drops back down as if the effort is too much. The
  forest feels vast and overwhelming around his small form.

  Hansel's legs were so tired from walking, and the butterfly was still so far away.
  Maybe he should just go back home where it was safe and warm.
