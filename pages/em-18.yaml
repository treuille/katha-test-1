  Emer sits on a moss-covered stone at the edge of the clearing, looking thoughtful
  and a bit tired. The magical convergence of streams continues behind her, but the
  sparkles have vanished completely. Hansel sits beside her, sensing her mood, his
  usual smile softer and more concerned. Emer is thinking hard, her artist's mind
  working on the puzzle. Around the clearing, we can see evidence of her long journey
  - her painting supplies looking worn, her dress a bit muddy, the light suggesting
  it's been a full day of searching. But in the background, barely visible, we can
  see a memory or vision - the sparkles from the very beginning, when she was painting
  and playing and completely joyful, before the quest began. The composition contrasts
  her current serious, tired state with the carefree joy she had at the start. Small
  forest creatures watch sympathetically. One tiny detail stands out: a single sparkle
  hovers near Hansel, who is still finding small moments of delight despite the
  journey. The forest is rendered in deep detail - showing both its beauty and the
  weight of their long search.

  As Emer watched the last sparkle fade, she understood: they appeared when she was
  playing and creating, full of pure joy. But after searching so hard for so long,
  that feeling seemed very far away.
