  Emer explores the Hidden Forest, searching for the sparkles. She moves with
  enthusiasm, pointing at different parts of the forest, peering behind waterfalls,
  looking under mushrooms, searching around twisted tree roots - the composition
  shows her as a small figure in a vast, detailed forest full of places to explore.
  The forest is rendered in loving detail - every moss-covered stone, every unusual
  flower, every babbling stream carefully depicted. Forest creatures watch her with
  interest - rabbits, birds, a curious fox. Emer's expression shows determination
  mixed with growing frustration; she so wants to find the sparkles again. She stops
  to examine interesting rocks and flowers, hoping for a clue. The light suggests
  late morning moving toward afternoon. Despite the beautiful forest around her,
  there are no sparkles to be seen anywhere.

  Emer searched everywhere for the magical sparkles - behind waterfalls, under
  flowers, around ancient trees. But no matter where she looked, the rainbow lights
  stayed hidden.
