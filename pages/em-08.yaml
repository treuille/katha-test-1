  Emer and Hansel stand together at a place where three different paths diverge into
  the Hidden Forest. The rainbow sparkles that had been leading them forward have
  suddenly vanished, leaving no trace of which way to go. Emer kneels beside Hansel,
  pointing at the different paths while Hansel looks up at her with his characteristic
  big smile, holding his colorful blocks. The three paths each look mysteriously different:
  one winds upward toward a distant waterfall, another descends into a moss-covered
  valley thick with ferns, and the third curves around massive ancient trees draped
  with hanging vines. The forest is rendered in exquisite detail - beetles on bark,
  tiny mushrooms, birds in branches - creating a sense of the infinite possibilities
  of the Hidden Forest. The light is dappled and mysterious, suggesting adventure but
  also uncertainty. Emer's expression shows both confusion and determination.

  The sparkles led them deeper into the forest, dancing ahead like they wanted to be
  followed. But at the three-path crossing, the lights simply vanished, leaving Emer
  and Hansel wondering which way to go.
