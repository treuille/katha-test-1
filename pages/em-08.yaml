  Emer and Hansel explore the Hidden Forest together, searching for the sparkles.
  Emer leads the way with enthusiasm, pointing at different parts of the forest
  while Hansel toddles along beside her, his colorful blocks tucked under one arm.
  They peer behind waterfalls, look under mushrooms, search around twisted tree
  roots - the composition shows them as small figures in a vast, detailed forest
  full of places to explore. The forest is rendered in loving detail - every moss-
  covered stone, every unusual flower, every babbling stream carefully depicted.
  Forest creatures watch them with interest - rabbits, birds, a curious fox. Emer's
  expression shows determination mixed with growing frustration; she so wants to
  find the sparkles to show Hansel. Hansel, meanwhile, seems perfectly happy just
  to be exploring with his sister, stopping to examine interesting rocks and flowers.
  The light suggests late morning moving toward afternoon. Despite the beautiful
  forest around them, there are no sparkles to be seen anywhere.

  Emer and Hansel searched everywhere for the magical sparkles - behind waterfalls,
  under flowers, around ancient trees. But no matter where they looked, the rainbow
  lights stayed hidden.
