visual: |
  A gentle garden edge where manicured lawn meets the wild forest beyond. One-year-old
  Hansel sits on the grass looking up at a large, wise-looking owl perched on a low
  branch. The owl has kind amber eyes and gestures with one wing toward the shadowy
  forest path ahead. The beautiful butterfly floats at the forest's edge, beckoning.
  Hansel's face shows wonder and curiosity, his characteristic smile bright despite
  a hint of uncertainty in his wide eyes. The contrast is clear - behind him, the
  safe familiar garden bathed in warm sunlight; ahead, the mysterious forest with
  dappled shadows and deeper greens. His geometric toys lie forgotten in the grass
  beside him as he contemplates this new adventure.

  The wise old owl ruffled his feathers and pointed toward the forest with his wing.
  "The butterfly's home is deep in there," he hooted gently, "where you've never
  been before."
