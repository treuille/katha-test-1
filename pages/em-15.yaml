payoff: New approach is tried based on the insight from previous spread.

description: The raccoon's advice leads nowhere, but as Emer catches her breath, she starts noticing a pattern in where the forest seems brightest.

visual: |
  Emer sits on a curved tree root, catching her breath after following the raccoon's
  wild goose chase. The raccoon has disappeared (perhaps visible in the far background,
  sneaking away). Hansel sits beside her, and she has her arm around him comfortingly.
  But as she rests, Emer's artist's eye begins to notice something: certain spots in
  the forest seem to glow more than others. There's a pattern to it - places where
  multiple water sources meet, where unique flowers cluster, where the light hits in
  particular ways. We see her gaze following these bright spots, her expression
  shifting from tired frustration to growing curiosity and understanding. The
  illustration shows several of these glowing spots at different distances, creating
  a visible pattern that the reader can also notice. The forest is rendered in
  extraordinary detail, with the special places subtly highlighted by natural light
  and clustering of magical elements (unusual flowers, glowing moss, crystalline
  rocks, upward-flowing water). Small forest creatures - mice, birds, beetles - are
  positioned at these bright spots, as if they know something. Emer's expression shows
  the light of realization beginning to dawn.

  After the raccoon's trick led them in circles, Emer sat down feeling frustrated.
  But as she looked around with her painter's eyes, she noticed something: the forest
  glowed brightest where water and flowers gathered together.
