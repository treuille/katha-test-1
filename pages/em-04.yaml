  Emer stands in a part of the forest she doesn't recognize, looking around with
  growing uncertainty. The sparkles have completely disappeared, leaving no trace of
  where they went. She's surrounded by magnificent ancient trees, unusual flowers,
  and streams flowing in unexpected directions - beautiful but unfamiliar. The forest
  stretches endlessly in all directions with no clear path home. Emer holds her bag
  of painting supplies close, her expression showing both wonder at the beauty around
  her and worry about being lost. The light is dappled and mysterious. Multiple
  paths branch off in different directions, but none show any sign of the sparkles.
  Forest creatures watch from a distance - some curious, some cautious. The
  illustration captures that moment of adventure turning into uncertainty, where
  excitement meets the first flutter of doubt. Every detail is lovingly rendered -
  the texture of ancient bark, the peculiar geometry of the flowers, the way light
  reflects off the water - creating a sense of being in a beautiful but unknown
  place.

  Just as suddenly as they appeared, the sparkles vanished, leaving Emer in a part
  of the forest she'd never seen before. She looked around, feeling very small and
  a little bit lost.
