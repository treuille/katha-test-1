  Still in the rainy forest, Emer looks even more withdrawn. She's holding one of
  her paintings, now wet and the colors running together in the rain, which feels
  like a metaphor for her defeated mood. The painting she made earlier - the one of
  the sparkles - is losing its colors, the rainbow swirls bleeding into muddy browns
  and grays. Emer stares at it with a heartbroken expression. Hansel has moved closer,
  leaning against her shoulder, offering his silent presence as comfort. The rain
  continues to fall. The forest seems vast and indifferent around them, stretching
  endlessly in all directions with no clear path home. The detailed rendering shows
  every raindrop, every wet leaf, every darkened stone - the beauty is still there
  in the craftsmanship, but the emotional weight is heavy. Small signs of hope are
  barely visible: a tiny flower that hasn't drooped, a single bird watching from a
  branch, a faint warmth in the light trying to break through the clouds in the far
  background. But Emer doesn't see these yet - she's lost in self-doubt. Her internal
  struggle is visible in her expression: disappointment, tiredness, and the question
  of whether she should keep trying.

  Looking at her ruined painting, Emer felt tears mix with the rain on her cheeks.
  "Maybe I'm not creative enough," she whispered to Hansel. "Maybe I should just give
  up and go home."
