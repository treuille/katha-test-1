  Emer has quickly gathered her favorite painting supplies into a small bag and is
  now following the trail of sparkles deeper into the forest. She walks with excited
  purpose, one hand reaching forward as if to touch the magical lights. The sparkles
  lead her through increasingly beautiful and unusual areas of the Hidden Forest -
  past a waterfall that flows in a spiral, under an archway of twisted vines covered
  in glowing moss, beside a stream where the water seems to shimmer with its own
  inner light. The forest is rendered in exquisite detail, showing the transition
  from familiar territory to somewhere more magical and mysterious. Emer's expression
  shows a mix of excitement and slight nervousness - she's going further than she
  usually goes alone. The sparkles stay just ahead of her, visible but always
  leading forward. Small creatures peek out from hiding spots, watching her journey.
  The light has taken on a dreamy quality, suggesting she's entering a more
  enchanted part of the forest.

  ever gone alone.
