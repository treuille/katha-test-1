  The clearing in warm late afternoon light. Cullan has arrived (echoing his presence
  from the opening page), and Emer is showing him the crystal and telling him about
  her adventure. She's animated and expressive, clearly excited to share her story.
  Cullan listens with his protective, gentle attention, his piercing blue eyes showing
  both pride and interest. He holds his camera, perhaps having photographed Emer in
  this moment of joyful storytelling. Hansel sits between them, happy to have both
  his siblings together. Around Emer, rainbow sparkles drift in the air, visible
  evidence of the magic she's learned to carry with her. The scene deliberately
  parallels the opening but shows growth: Emer is more confident, more centered, more
  aware of her own power to create joy and beauty. Her painted stones are scattered
  around, but they're even more beautiful and creative than before. The forest
  stretches endlessly in the background, full of promise and mystery, suggesting that
  this is one adventure complete but many more are possible. The wise bear is barely
  visible in the far distance, watching over them. Small details hint at "series
  button" - other paths leading from the clearing, other parts of the forest still to
  explore, the crystal suggesting other magical elements in this world. Everything is
  rendered with the same extraordinary detail and care, creating a sense of
  completion that also opens toward future possibilities.

  "The sparkles were always here," Emer told Cullan, touching the crystal in her
  pocket, "I just had to learn to see them." She smiled at her brothers, ready for
  whatever the Hidden Forest would show them next.
