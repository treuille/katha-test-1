visual: |
  Emer sits on a moss-covered log, having given up the search for now. Her painting
  supplies are spread beside her, and she's started painting just to relax - not
  trying to find anything, just creating for joy. She hums softly to herself,
  swaying gently as she paints, occasionally dancing a little twirl before returning
  to her work. The scene is peaceful and happy - Emer absorbed in her creative play.
  And there, appearing as if drawn by her joy, are the rainbow sparkles - just a
  few at first, dancing in the air around her. The sparkles are rendered with
  luminous detail, appearing naturally as if they belong to this moment of simple
  happiness. She hasn't noticed them yet; she's too focused on her painting. The
  forest around her is beautiful and detailed, and the light has a warm, magical
  quality. Small creatures watch from nearby - a rabbit, mice, birds - all seemingly
  pleased by this development. The composition captures the moment just before she
  notices, creating anticipation.
