  Emer sits cross-legged on a moss-covered log, her painting supplies spread around
  her in organized chaos. She's painting sparkles on a large sheet of paper propped
  against a tree - swirls of purple, blue, and gold watercolors representing the
  magical lights she saw. Hansel sits nearby, clapping encouragingly and stacking his
  colorful blocks into a tower. The forest around them is beautifully detailed with
  afternoon light filtering through the canopy. Small forest creatures - a curious
  squirrel, a pair of mice, a bright blue bird - watch from nearby branches and rocks,
  their expressions suggesting gentle amusement at the children's efforts. Despite
  Emer's beautiful painting, no actual magical sparkles appear. Her expression shows
  concentration and hope, even as we can see this approach isn't working. The
  composition contrasts her artistic creation with the magical reality she's trying
  to capture, showing the gap between representation and manifestation.

  "Maybe if I paint them, they'll come back!" Emer said, creating swirls of rainbow
  colors on her paper. But the real sparkles stayed hidden, no matter how beautiful
  her painting became.
