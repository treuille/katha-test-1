description: Tired from searching, Emer and Hansel take a break to play, and the sparkles suddenly appear.

  Emer sits on a moss-covered log, having given up the search for now. Her painting
  supplies are spread beside her, and she's started painting just to relax - not
  trying to find anything, just creating for joy. Hansel plays nearby, building a
  tower with his colorful blocks and giggling with delight each time he adds a new
  piece. The scene is peaceful and happy - both children absorbed in their creative
  play. And there, appearing as if drawn by their joy, are the rainbow sparkles -
  just a few at first, dancing in the air around them. The sparkles are rendered
  with luminous detail, appearing naturally as if they belong to this moment of
  simple happiness. Neither child has noticed them yet; they're too focused on
  their play. The forest around them is beautiful and detailed, and the light has
  a warm, magical quality. Small creatures watch from nearby - a rabbit, mice, birds
  - all seemingly pleased by this development. The composition captures the moment
  just before the children notice, creating anticipation.

  Emer stopped searching and started painting just for fun, while Hansel built a
  wobbly tower with his blocks. Neither noticed when rainbow sparkles began to appear
  in the air around them, drawn by their laughter.
