description: Following her pattern, Emer reaches a magical place where the sparkles briefly appear, but they fade away before she can understand them fully.

  Emer and Hansel stand in the most magical place they've found yet - a circular
  clearing where seven different streams converge, each flowing at different angles
  (some upward, some sideways, one spiraling). The water creates a symphony of sound
  and movement. Unusual flowers in impossible colors surround the clearing in perfect
  symmetry. And there, hovering just above the water, are the rainbow sparkles -
  dancing, shimmering, more beautiful than Emer remembered. The sparkles are rendered
  with luminous detail, each one a tiny burst of shifting color. Emer reaches out
  toward them with joy and wonder on her face, Hansel clapping his hands in delight
  beside her. But even as we see this moment of discovery, the sparkles are already
  beginning to fade at the edges, becoming translucent, starting to disappear. The
  forest around them is rendered in extraordinary detail - every flower petal, every
  water droplet catching light, every piece of moss and stone. Forest creatures watch
  from every direction - bears in the background, deer, rabbits, birds, mice - all
  observing this almost-moment. The light is magical but also showing the transience
  of the sparkles' appearance.

  The sparkles appeared like magic, dancing above the water exactly as Emer had hoped!
  But even as she and Hansel laughed with joy, the lights began to fade, drifting
  away like they were searching for something.
