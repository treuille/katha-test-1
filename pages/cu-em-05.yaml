# Visual description for the illustrator
visual: |
  The forest has grown wild and dense here, with twisted vines hanging from towering trees
  and strange, oversized ferns creating an almost jungle-like atmosphere. In a small clearing
  near a rushing stream, Cullan and Emer have found each other. The composition shows two
  moments in sequence: First, they're embracing with relief, Cullan protective with his hand
  on her shoulder, Emer holding her painting supplies close. But then, the main focus: Emer
  sits on a moss-covered log, painting to calm herself while Cullan watches thoughtfully. As
  she creates, her worry fading into concentration, faint rainbow sparkles begin to appear in
  the air around her—drawn by her creative joy, not her searching. Cullan's expression shows
  the moment of realization dawning: his piercing blue eyes are bright with understanding, his
  gentle smile showing both love and recognition of what his sister truly needs. He's kneeling
  beside her, one hand gesturing toward where the sparkles are drifting deeper into the forest,
  the other touching her shoulder reassuringly. Emer looks up at him with uncertainty—should
  she stay with him or follow the sparkles? The light here is different from their familiar
  forest—greener, stranger, with odd plants that glow faintly. In the background, a wide stream
  rushes past with massive waterfalls, and across it, barely visible, the glowing mushrooms
  Cullan seeks. The composition emphasizes the fork in their paths: sparkles leading one
  direction, stream crossing another. Small details include unusual insects with iridescent
  wings, the contrast between Cullan's analytical observation and Emer's unconscious creativity,
  and the visible love between siblings even as they realize they need different paths.

# The text that appears on the page

  When Cullan found Emer in the deep forest, they hugged tight with relief. But as Emer painted
  to calm herself, Cullan noticed rainbow sparkles appearing around her joy. "The sparkles come
  to you when you're happy," he said gently. "Go follow them—I believe in you." With his
  encouragement warming her heart, Emer headed after the lights while Cullan turned back to his stream.
