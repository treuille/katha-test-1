# Short description of what happens on this page
description: Cullan and Emer find each other in the deep forest. When Emer paints to calm herself, sparkles appear. Cullan realizes she doesn't need his protection—she needs to follow her own joy. As a loving brother, he encourages her to go chase the sparkles alone.

# Visual description for the illustrator
visual: |
  Emer sits painting on a moss-covered log, paintbrush in hand, with rainbow sparkles
  appearing in the air around her. Cullan kneels beside her, one hand on her shoulder,
  the other hand pointing toward where the sparkles drift deeper into the forest.
  His expression shows realization and encouragement. Emer looks up at him with
  uncertainty, torn between staying with her brother and following the sparkles.
  A stream flows behind them. The sparkles lead one direction into the forest,
  while the stream leads another direction.

# The text that appears on the page
text: |
  When Cullan found Emer in the deep forest, they hugged tight with relief. But as Emer painted
  to calm herself, Cullan noticed rainbow sparkles appearing around her joy. "The sparkles come
  to you when you're happy," he said gently. "Go follow them—I believe in you." With his
  encouragement warming her heart, Emer headed after the lights while Cullan turned back to his stream.
