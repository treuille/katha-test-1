# Visual description for the illustrator
visual: |
  The forest has grown wild and dense here, with twisted vines hanging from towering trees
  and strange, oversized ferns creating an almost jungle-like atmosphere. Cullan and Emer
  stand close together in a small clearing—Cullan protective, one hand on Emer's shoulder,
  while Emer looks around with wide-eyed wonder mixed with slight apprehension. Before them
  struts a magnificent red fox with an almost theatrical air, its tail held high, its
  expression supremely confident and charming. The fox is gesturing with one paw, as if
  offering guidance. The light here is different from their familiar forest—greener,
  stranger, with odd plants that seem to glow faintly. In the background, massive waterfalls
  cascade from impossible heights, their mist creating rainbow effects. Emer clutches one of
  her painted stones, a small comfort in this unfamiliar place. Cullan's blue eyes show both
  his protective instinct and growing caution about the fox's overconfident demeanor. Small
  details include unusual insects with iridescent wings, mushrooms in impossible colors, and
  the contrast between the siblings' cautious body language and the fox's breezy confidence.
  The composition emphasizes both their bond and their venture into unknown territory.

# The text that appears on the page

  Deep in the unfamiliar forest, Cullan and Emer met a fox who promised to show them
  the way. "I know exactly where you need to go," the fox said with a flourish, but
  something in its smile made Cullan hold Emer's hand a little tighter.
