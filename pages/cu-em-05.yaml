visual: |
  A sun-dappled clearing in the Hidden Forest, where a crystal-clear stream winds
  through moss-covered stones. Cullan sits on a large flat rock near the water's edge,
  his camera resting beside him, watching his sister with a gentle, protective smile.
  Emer dances nearby, her curly blonde hair catching the golden light filtering through
  the forest canopy. She's twirling with her arms outstretched, laughing, her dress
  swirling around her. Painted stones are scattered around her—her artistic creations
  from earlier. The forest surrounds them with rich greens and blues, waterfalls visible
  in the misty distance. The scene is peaceful yet full of life, showing their comfort
  in this magical place. Cullan's piercing blue eyes reflect both contentment and a hint
  of watchfulness, while Emer's expression is pure joy. The composition uses warm light
  to emphasize the safety and warmth of their relationship.

# The text that appears on the page
text: |
  In the heart of the Hidden Forest, where sunlight dances on stream water and trees
  whisper ancient secrets, Cullan watched his little sister Emer twirl and laugh.
  This clearing was their special place—a world within a world where they were free
  to be exactly who they were. Cullan felt a familiar warmth in his chest, the kind
  that came from knowing someone needed you and you needed them just the same.
