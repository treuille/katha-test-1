  In a grove of massive, moss-covered trees, Emer and Hansel stand before an enormous
  but gentle-looking bear. The bear is ancient and wise, with silvery-brown fur and
  kind, knowing eyes. She sits on her haunches like a grandmother telling a story,
  one large paw gesturing toward the deeper, wilder parts of the forest visible in
  the background. The bear is rendered with extraordinary detail - every hair, every
  thoughtful wrinkle around her eyes. Emer looks up at her with wide eyes, listening
  intently, while Hansel clutches his blocks and stays close to his sister. Around
  them, the forest shows its infinite detail - intricate patterns of lichen on bark,
  delicate ferns, tiny flowers, and watching creatures (rabbits, birds, a fox) who
  respect this wise being. The light filtering through the trees creates a sacred,
  timeless quality to the scene. In the distant background, we can glimpse unfamiliar
  territory: darker, denser forest with mysterious blue shadows and the hint of
  strange waterfalls flowing at odd angles.

  The ancient bear listened to Emer's question and nodded slowly. "The rainbow
  sparkles dance in the Deep Heart of the forest," she rumbled gently, "but the path
  there winds through places you've never been."
