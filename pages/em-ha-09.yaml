description: Hansel suddenly perks up and starts dancing like he does at home. His dancing makes the branch sway, and Emer realizes - the vines she painted earlier were vine bridges! They can use them to cross!

  A moment of pure magic and realization. Hansel has perked up and is doing
  his characteristic happy dance on the branch, his little body swaying to
  music only he can hear, his huge smile back in full force. The branch sways
  gently with his movement, and as it does, it comes near some hanging vines
  that Emer hadn't noticed before. Emer's expression transforms from despair
  to sudden inspiration - her eyes widen and light up. In a small insert or
  thought bubble, we see her earlier painting from spread 1, which included
  vines as bridges. The vines before them are thick and sturdy, woven together
  naturally, and they span the gap to the waterfall area. The setting sun
  catches everything in warm, hopeful light.

  But then Hansel wiggled and started to dance - the same happy dance he did
  at home. Emer couldn't help but smile as the branch swayed with his movement.
  Wait - the swaying brought them near some thick vines she hadn't noticed!
  They looked just like the vine bridges she'd painted that morning. "Hansel!
  You did it again!" Maybe they could use the vines to cross!
