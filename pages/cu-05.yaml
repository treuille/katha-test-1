# Visual description for the illustrator

  The forest has grown wild and dense here, with twisted vines hanging from towering trees
  and strange, oversized ferns creating an almost jungle-like atmosphere. Cullan stands in a
  small clearing, looking tired from his journey—his clothes slightly rumpled, a smudge of
  dirt on his cheek, his blonde hair more tousled than usual. Before him struts a magnificent
  red fox with an almost theatrical air, its tail held high, its expression supremely confident
  and perhaps a bit too charming. The fox is gesturing with one paw toward a narrow path that
  winds between enormous tree roots and disappears into shadow—a path that looks distinctly
  precarious, with loose stones and steep drops visible. The light here is different from the
  familiar forest—greener, stranger, with odd plants that seem to glow faintly. In the
  background, massive waterfalls cascade from impossible heights, their mist creating rainbow
  effects in the strange light. Cullan's expression is skeptical but desperate—his blue eyes
  showing both his inherent caution and his pressing desire to reach his goal. The fox's
  demeanor is almost comic in its overconfidence, whiskers twitching with self-assurance.
  Small details include unusual insects with iridescent wings, mushrooms in colors that don't
  quite exist in the normal world, and twisted root systems that create natural stairs and
  archways. The composition emphasizes the contrast between the fox's breezy confidence and
  the obviously dangerous path.

  "Oh, I know exactly where you need to go," the fox said with a flourish, pointing to
  a steep, narrow path between twisted roots. Cullan hesitated, studying the dangerous-
  looking route with growing doubt.
