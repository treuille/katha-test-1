  Emer has looked up from her painting, brush suspended in mid-air, her eyes wide
  with wonder. Between the trees ahead of her, tiny rainbow sparkles dance and float
  like magical fireflies - each one shifting through the spectrum of colors from
  purple to blue to green to gold. The sparkles are rendered with luminous detail,
  each one glowing and leaving a faint trail of light. They seem to be drifting
  deeper into the forest, creating a winding path of light and color. The contrast
  between Emer's painted colors on her paper and the real magical sparkles in the
  air is beautiful - art meeting magic. The forest creatures have also noticed,
  watching the sparkles with interest. Emer's expression shows pure amazement and
  curiosity, her creative mind already wondering what they are and where they're
  going. The light has shifted slightly, becoming more mystical as the sparkles
  illuminate the spaces between trees. Every detail of the forest is carefully
  rendered, but the sparkles draw the eye forward.

  Rainbow sparkles appeared between the trees, dancing and swirling like nothing
  Emer had ever seen before. They seemed to be calling to her, inviting her to follow.
