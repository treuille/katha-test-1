# Visual description for the illustrator
visual: |
  Cullan is three-quarters of the way across the stream, balanced confidently on the network
  of natural bridges he discovered. He's moving with careful grace, using the low willow
  branches and exposed root systems exactly as the small creatures showed him. The stream
  rushes beneath him, but he's well above it, secure on his natural highway. His camera swings
  from his neck as he moves, and his expression shows focused determination mixed with growing
  excitement—he's so close! The glowing mushrooms are just ahead on the far bank, their
  ethereal blue-green light pulsing invitingly. But here's the problem: the final willow
  branch extends toward the bank, and Cullan is reaching for the next root system, but there's
  a gap—perhaps two feet—between where the branch ends and where the mushrooms grow. He's
  stretched out, one hand gripping the branch, the other reaching toward the bank, his face
  showing the realization that he's just short of his goal. The light is beginning to fade
  toward evening, giving everything a golden-blue quality that makes the glowing mushrooms
  even more striking. In the water below, fish jump, adding a sense of time passing and
  urgency. Small birds watch from nearby branches, as if curious whether this tall human will
  solve the puzzle. The composition emphasizes the tantalizingly close goal and the small but
  significant gap that remains. Details include the texture of the willow bark under Cullan's
  hands, the mist from the stream creating tiny rainbows, and the careful placement of his
  feet on the root system below.

  Following the natural bridges, Cullan made it most of the way across—but the last branch
  stopped just short of the far bank. He stretched toward the glowing mushrooms, his
  fingertips two feet from success.
