  A transformative moment in the forest. One-year-old Hansel sits up straighter,
  his eyes widening with recognition. Before him, a patch of flowers creates a
  familiar geometric pattern - circular blooms arranged like his spheres, pyramid-
  shaped flowers pointing upward like his toys, cube-shaped buds clustered together.
  The connection sparks something in him, and his characteristic bright smile
  returns to his face. He reaches out to touch the flowers gently, and suddenly
  the butterfly lands nearby as if acknowledging his renewed spirit. The storm
  clouds part slightly, allowing a single beam of golden light to break through,
  illuminating the geometric flower pattern. In this moment, the unfamiliar forest
  connects to his familiar world, and his confidence blooms like the flowers around
  him. His small hand traces the pattern in wonder.

  Then Hansel saw it - the flowers made the same shapes as his favorite toys at home!
  Suddenly he knew he could do this, because the forest wasn't so different after all.
