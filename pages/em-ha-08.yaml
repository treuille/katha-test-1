beat: "All-is-lost / emotional low"
hook: Self-doubt surfaces, questioning whether continuing is worth it.
payoff: Something affirms that the effort matters and creates emotional reconnection.

description: Emer feels discouraged and tired. Hansel seems tired too, no longer smiling. The sun is setting, and Emer wonders if they should just go home.

  The golden light is fading to twilight blues and purples. Emer sits slumped
  on the mossy branch, her painting supplies forgotten in her small backpack.
  Hansel sits in her lap, leaning against her chest, unusually quiet and still
  - not his normal smiley self. Both children look exhausted. The waterfall
  still glows beautifully in the distance, but it feels unreachable. Shadows
  are lengthening in the forest. Emer's expression shows doubt and weariness -
  her shoulders are drooped, and she's looking back the way they came rather
  than forward. The composition emphasizes their smallness against the vast
  forest and the growing darkness.

  Emer's arms were tired from carrying Hansel. Her legs were tired from climbing.
  Even Hansel wasn't smiling anymore. The forest was getting dark. "Maybe we
  should go home," Emer whispered. "Maybe we weren't meant to reach the waterfall
  after all." She felt like she had let her little brother down.
