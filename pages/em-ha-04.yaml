description: A wise old owl appears and tells them the stream can only be followed from above - they need to climb the trees and follow it from the canopy.

visual: |
  A majestic ancient owl perches on a low branch, its amber eyes wise and kind.
  The owl's feathers are silver-grey with hints of blue that echo the stream's
  glow. Emer stands attentively, holding Hansel on her hip as he reaches one
  chubby hand toward the owl in fascination. The owl gestures with one wing
  toward the canopy above, where we can see branches forming a natural pathway
  between the trees. Through the leaves above, we glimpse the stream's course
  continuing through the forest - visible from above but not from the ground.
  Emer's expression shows understanding dawning, though there's a hint of
  uncertainty about climbing so high with her little brother.

  "Hoo-hoo," called a wise old owl from above. "The stream's path can only be
  seen from the treetops, young ones. You must climb up high, but take care -
  the branches can be tricky, and the way is long." Emer looked up at the tall
  trees and then at Hansel. Could they really climb that high together?
