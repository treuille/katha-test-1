  Thirteen-year-old Cullan stands at the edge of a sunlit forest clearing, his
  bouncy blonde hair catching the golden afternoon light. His piercing blue eyes
  scan the canopy above, looking for the perfect angle. Around his neck hangs his
  beloved camera. His lanky frame leans against an old oak tree as he adjusts
  the camera settings. The forest stretches before him, mysterious and inviting,
  with shafts of light breaking through the leaves.

  Cullan stepped into the forest, his camera ready. This was his favorite thing—
  finding beauty in the quiet places where no one else looked. The trees whispered
  in the breeze, and somewhere in the distance, he heard the gentle babble of a
  stream.

  "Just me and the forest," he whispered to himself, his shy smile appearing as
  he raised the camera to his eye. Click. The perfect shot of light filtering
  through leaves.

  But today felt different somehow. As if the forest was waiting to show him
  something more than just a beautiful photograph. Something he hadn't expected
  to find.
