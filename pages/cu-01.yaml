  A peaceful corner of the Hidden Forest bathed in soft morning light. Thirteen-year-old
  Cullan sits cross-legged on a moss-covered log, his camera raised to his eye as he
  photographs a cluster of ordinary mushrooms growing on a nearby tree. His bouncy blonde
  hair catches the golden light, and his piercing blue eyes are focused through the viewfinder.
  Around him, the forest is beautiful but familiar—he knows every tree, every rock, every
  stream in this area. His backpack rests beside him with a well-worn fantasy novel peeking
  out. Scattered around are a few photographs he's already taken and developed—all technically
  perfect but somehow lacking magic. The composition shows Cullan's gentle, introspective
  nature, but also a subtle restlessness in his posture. In the background, a crystal stream
  babbles past, waterfalls cascade in the distance, and small forest creatures go about their
  business—mice, birds, beetles. Everything is safe, known, comfortable. But Cullan's
  expression reveals a quiet longing for something extraordinary, something worth the perfect
  photograph. The scene captures that moment before adventure begins, when the ordinary world
  feels just slightly too small. Details include: his careful handling of the camera, the
  technical precision of his composition, a half-eaten pancake wrapped in cloth (breakfast
  from home), and the way his eyes keep drifting beyond what's in his viewfinder, searching
  for something more.

  Cullan photographed the same mushrooms he'd captured a dozen times before, each shot
  technically perfect but missing something he couldn't name. He lowered his camera and
  gazed deeper into the forest, wondering if there was anything truly extraordinary left
  to find.
