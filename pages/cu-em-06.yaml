  Cullan and Emer now both crouch at the stream's edge, their faces close together,
  reflected in the water below. Beneath the surface, something ethereal and beautiful
  glows with a soft, otherworldly light—perhaps a cluster of luminescent stones or
  a submerged entrance marked with ancient symbols. Emer's small hand points excitedly
  at the glow while Cullan's protective arm is gently placed around her shoulders,
  steadying her so she doesn't fall in. Both their faces show wonder and curiosity—
  Emer's expression is pure excitement with wide eyes and an open-mouthed smile, while
  Cullan's shows careful interest mixed with his instinct to keep his sister safe.
  The glowing light from below illuminates their faces with blues and greens. Water
  ripples create dancing patterns of light across their features. The forest seems to
  lean in around them, as if the trees themselves are curious about what the siblings
  have found. In the background, the mist from distant waterfalls seems to shimmer
  with the same mysterious light.

  "Cullan, look!" Emer's voice rang with excitement as she pointed at the water.

  There, beneath the rippling surface, something glowed with colors they'd never seen
  before—deeper than blue, brighter than starlight. Cullan's protective instinct kicked
  in as he steadied his sister, but he couldn't help feeling it too: that pull of
  mystery, that whisper of magic calling them to discover what lay hidden beneath
  the stream they thought they knew so well.
