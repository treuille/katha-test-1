  Emer and Hansel meet in a sunny clearing of The Hidden Forest. Emer has her
  painting supplies spread around her, her curly blonde hair catching the light.
  Hansel toddles over with his characteristic big smile, carrying colorful
  geometric blocks. The forest around them is lush and magical, with soft
  greens and golden light filtering through the ancient trees. Both children
  look happy to see each other.

  Emer was painting in her favorite clearing when she heard a familiar giggle.
  It was Hansel! Her little brother had found her secret spot. "Want to play
  together?" Emer asked with a smile. Hansel clapped his hands happily.
