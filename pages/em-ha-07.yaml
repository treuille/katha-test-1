beat: "Rising stakes: almost works"
hook: Success is close but incomplete, with a detail revealing what's still needed.
payoff: What's missing is revealed to be distant or difficult to reach.

description: Following the mossy branches works beautifully, and they can see a magnificent waterfall ahead - the stream's source! But there's a gap in the branches right before they can reach it.

  A breathtaking vista opens before them. Emer and Hansel stand on a mossy
  branch at the edge of a gap, looking toward a stunning waterfall cascading
  down from high above. The waterfall glows with the same magical light as the
  stream, creating rainbows in its mist. It's so close - maybe twenty feet away -
  but there's an empty space between their branch and the landing near the falls.
  Below, the stream pools in a beautiful clearing with luminous flowers. Emer
  holds Hansel securely, her face showing a mix of awe at the beauty and
  frustration at being so close yet unable to reach their destination. Hansel
  points at the waterfall, his expression full of wonder.

  The mossy path led them higher and higher until - there! A magnificent
  waterfall poured down from the rocks above, filling the air with rainbows
  and music. But between them and the waterfall was a gap too wide to jump,
  especially with Hansel. They were so close! What could they do now?
