  A moment of quiet observation in the forest. One-year-old Hansel sits very still
  on a mossy log, his usual bouncy energy transformed into focused attention. His
  bright eyes track the butterfly as it moves through the air, and his expression
  shows the dawning of understanding - his characteristic smile now tinged with
  wonder and discovery. Around him, the forest reveals its patterns: bright yellow,
  purple, and orange flowers dot the landscape, and the butterfly lands on each
  colorful bloom in sequence. Hansel's small hand points toward a particularly
  vibrant patch of flowers ahead. Geometric shapes of nature echo his toy
  collection - round flower heads, cone-shaped blooms, spherical seed pods.
  Sunlight breaks through the canopy in clear rays, illuminating the path forward
  marked by flowers.

  Hansel sat very still and watched where the butterfly went. Every single time,
  it landed on the brightest, most colorful flowers!
