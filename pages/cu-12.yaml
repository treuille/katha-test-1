  The sun-dappled clearing from Spread 1, but now it's later in the day—late afternoon light
  creating longer, warmer shadows. Cullan and Emer sit together on the large flat rock by the
  stream, their heads close together as they look at the photograph of the glowing mushrooms.
  The scene mirrors the opening but with subtle, important differences that show transformation.
  Emer holds the photograph carefully, her eyes wide with wonder, while Cullan watches her
  reaction with his gentle, protective smile—but there's something new in his expression now:
  a quiet confidence, a deeper understanding. Between them on the rock sits Emer's painted
  stone, cleaned and returned, placed with honor. The forest around them is the same—their
  safe, magical clearing—but we see it now with the appreciation Cullan has gained: the tiny
  details, the natural paths, the way everything connects. In the background, we can see
  Cullan's camera and a few other photographs he's developing—images of the journey: the owl,
  the willow branches, the stream. Emer's painted stones are still scattered around, but now
  one of them has a new decoration—she's added a tiny painted glowing mushroom to honor his
  story. The waterfalls in the distant mist, the moss-covered stones, the crystal-clear
  stream—all remain, but they're seen through eyes that better understand both challenge and
  connection. Cullan's arm is around Emer's shoulders in a brotherly protective gesture, and
  her hand touches his arm in return. Small details include: new photographs drying on a line
  nearby, Emer's art supplies ready for more painting, a small jar where she's collected some
  of her own glowing mushrooms from the clearing, and visible in Cullan's other pocket, his
  notebook with sketches and notes from his journey. The composition creates a sense of
  completion and continuity—the same clearing, the same love, but deeper now. The final image
  suggests ongoing adventures to come, with both children looking not just at the photograph
  but toward something in the forest beyond, as if already imagining the next discovery.

  In their clearing, Cullan showed Emer the photograph, and she traced the glowing mushrooms
  with gentle fingers, understanding without words what the journey had meant. The Hidden
  Forest stretched endlessly around them, full of infinite wonders still waiting to be
  discovered together.
