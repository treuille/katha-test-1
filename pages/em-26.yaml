description: Emer and Hansel begin walking home through the forest, the path clearer now, carrying what they've learned.

visual: |
  Emer and Hansel walk hand-in-hand through the forest, heading back toward familiar
  territory. The path ahead is clear and welcoming, no longer mysterious or
  frightening. Emer carries the crystal carefully in her other hand, and it catches
  the golden late-afternoon light. Both children look tired but happy - the
  exhaustion of a good adventure completed. The forest is transitioning from the
  wild, strange depths back toward the more familiar areas. We can see both in the
  composition: behind them, the twisted trees and upward-flowing water of the deep
  forest; ahead of them, the gentler, more familiar woodland with normal streams and
  comfortable moss. The wise bear watches them go from a distant hill, a protective
  presence. Other creatures wave goodbye - rabbits, deer, birds. Small details suggest
  the hint of future possibility: a few sparkles still float in the air around Emer
  as she walks, drawn by her inner joy even without trying; some of her paintings
  are tucked under her arm, documenting the journey; Hansel chatters happily, clearly
  already planning their next adventure. The forest path ahead curves around familiar
  trees, suggesting that home is not far. Everything is rendered in the same careful
  detail, but the emotional tone is now peaceful completion rather than seeking.

  With the crystal safely in her pocket and Hansel's hand in hers, Emer walked toward
  home. The forest seemed different now - not because it had changed, but because
  she understood it better.
