  A warm, sun-drenched forest clearing filled with soft moss and wildflowers.
  One-year-old Hansel sits in the center, his face radiant with his signature
  smile. Around him are scattered colorful geometric objects—bright blue cubes,
  yellow spheres, red pyramids, green cylinders—each one catching the sunlight.
  Hansel's small hands reach for a blue cube, his eyes wide with wonder and joy.
  He looks exactly like his dad, handsome and happy, completely absorbed in the
  magic of play and discovery.

  Hansel giggled with delight as his fingers closed around the bright blue cube.
  It was smooth and cool, perfect for exploring. He turned it over and over,
  watching how the sunlight danced across its surfaces.

  "Bah!" he exclaimed, his favorite sound, as he spotted the yellow sphere. He
  reached for it, and it rolled just out of reach, making him laugh even harder.
  Everything was a game, everything was fun.

  The forest clearing was his playground, these geometric shapes his treasures.
  And somewhere nearby, he could hear footsteps approaching—someone was coming
  to join his adventure.
