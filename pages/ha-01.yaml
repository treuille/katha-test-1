  A cozy, sunlit corner of a warm home where one-year-old Hansel sits on a soft
  rug surrounded by his favorite geometric toys - colorful cubes, spheres, and
  pyramids scattered around him. His signature bright smile lights up his face
  as he stacks blocks, his handsome features showing his resemblance to his dad.
  Through a nearby window, mysterious golden light filters in, catching dancing
  motes of dust. Hansel pauses mid-play, his attention drawn to gentle sounds
  coming from outside - the rustling of leaves, distant laughter, the promise of
  something wonderful. His eyes widen with curiosity as he looks toward the window,
  one hand still holding a blue pyramid.

  Hansel was having the best time stacking his colorful blocks into wobbly towers
  that tumbled down with delightful crashes. But then he heard something magical
  outside - was that music and laughter?
