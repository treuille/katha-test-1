visual: |
  A cozy, sunlit corner of a warm home where one-year-old Hansel sits on a soft
  rug surrounded by his favorite geometric toys - colorful cubes, spheres, and
  pyramids scattered around him. His signature bright smile lights up his face
  as he stacks blocks, his handsome features showing his resemblance to his dad.
  Through the open garden door, a beautiful iridescent butterfly flutters inside,
  dancing through beams of golden sunlight. Hansel pauses mid-play, mesmerized,
  as the butterfly circles around him once, twice, then floats back toward the
  door. His eyes widen with wonder and delight as he begins to toddle after it,
  one hand still holding a blue pyramid. The butterfly beckons him from the safe
  indoor space toward the sunny garden and the mysterious forest edge beyond.

  Hansel was stacking his colorful blocks when a beautiful butterfly danced right
  through his door! It fluttered around his toys, then floated back outside. Hansel
  giggled and toddle-ran after it into the garden, toward the forest.
