  Emer waves goodbye to Cullan (visible in the background of the clearing) and heads
  into the forest with renewed energy and purpose. Her posture shows confidence - head
  up, walking with determination. She carries her painting supplies and a small bag.
  The familiar clearing is behind her, bathed in warm light, while the forest path
  ahead winds into more mysterious territory. The transition from known to unknown
  is visible in the composition - warm, comfortable greens and golds behind her
  shifting to cooler, more mystical blues and purples ahead. Emer's expression shows
  excitement rather than fear this time; her moment with her brother has given her
  courage. In the distance ahead, barely visible, a few rainbow sparkles drift between
  trees, as if waiting for her. Small forest creatures watch her journey with
  interest - rabbits, birds, a young deer. The forest is rendered in loving detail,
  every fern and flower carefully depicted. The path ahead looks inviting rather than
  frightening, suggesting that Emer's mindset has shifted from lost to adventuring.
