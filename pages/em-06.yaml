  Emer walks through the forest with renewed confidence and purpose. Her posture shows
  determination—head up, steps sure—but there's also warmth in her expression as she
  remembers her brother's belief in her. She carries her painting supplies and touches a
  small smooth stone in her pocket (perhaps something Cullan gave her as they parted, a
  comfort token). Ahead of her, a few rainbow sparkles drift between trees, leading her
  deeper into the beautiful strange forest. The path winds through magnificent ancient trees,
  unusual flowers in impossible colors, and streams that catch the light. The transition
  from where she left Cullan to where she's going is visible in the composition—warm, golden
  light behind her shifting to cooler, more mystical blues and purples ahead. But unlike
  when she was lost before, Emer doesn't look frightened—she looks brave. Her expression
  shows she's drawing strength from her brother's encouragement: "I believe in you" echoing
  in her heart. Small forest creatures watch her journey with interest—rabbits, birds, a
  young deer. The sparkles stay ahead of her, visible but always drifting forward. The
  forest is rendered in loving detail, every fern and flower carefully depicted. The scene
  captures that beautiful moment when someone else's belief in you helps you find courage
  you didn't know you had.

  With Cullan's words—"I believe in you"—warming her heart, Emer followed the sparkles
  with new confidence. She wasn't searching desperately anymore; she was adventuring
  bravely, trusting herself the way her brother trusted her.
