  Emer stands at the edge of the clearing, her painting supplies forgotten at her feet.
  Her curly blonde hair frames her face as she gazes with wonder toward the deeper forest.
  Between the ancient trees, tiny sparkles of iridescent light dance and flutter like
  magical fireflies - shimmering in rainbow colors that shift from purple to blue to
  gold. The sparkles seem to be leading deeper into the Hidden Forest, creating a
  winding trail of light through the moss-covered trees. The forest around her is
  rendered in rich detail - every leaf and stone visible - but the magical lights draw
  the eye forward. Emer's expression shows pure curiosity and delight, her hands clasped
  together in excitement. The watercolor wash creates a dreamy atmosphere where the
  ordinary forest begins to reveal its magical nature. Small forest creatures - mice,
  beetles, birds - peek out from their hiding spots, also watching the lights with interest.

  Emer's paintbrush stilled as sparkles of rainbow light danced between the trees,
  something she'd never seen in all her adventures here. Where were they going?
