  A breathtaking threshold moment. One-year-old Hansel stands at the edge of the
  most magnificent garden he's ever seen - a vast meadow filled with thousands of
  flowers in every color imaginable, and hundreds of butterflies dancing in the
  air like living rainbows. The garden glows with an almost magical quality, golden
  sunlight making everything shimmer. Hansel pauses at the entrance, one small foot
  lifted, hesitating at this moment of truth. His face shows awe mixed with a
  flicker of uncertainty - this is bigger and more beautiful than anything he
  imagined. The butterfly he followed waits just inside the garden, perched on a
  particularly vibrant flower, as if inviting him in. Behind him, the dark forest
  he conquered; before him, the reward for his journey. Then, with his characteristic
  smile breaking across his face, he takes that brave toddler step forward into
  the wonder.
