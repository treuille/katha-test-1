  A warm, sunlit clearing in The Hidden Forest. Emer sits on a mossy log with her
  painting supplies spread around her, her curly blonde hair catching the light.
  Hansel toddles nearby, smiling as he plays with colorful geometric blocks on the
  soft grass. In the background, between the ancient trees, something catches the
  light - a mysterious shimmer of water that wasn't there before. The forest is
  alive with soft greens and golden light filtering through the canopy. Emer's
  expression shows contentment mixed with growing curiosity as her gaze drifts
  toward the sparkling unknown.

  Emer painted happy pictures while her little brother Hansel played nearby.
  The Hidden Forest was their favorite place to spend time together. But today,
  something sparkled between the trees - something new and mysterious.
