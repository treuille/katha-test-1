  Dawn is breaking over the Hidden Forest as Cullan makes his way back along familiar paths.
  The journey that seemed so difficult in the other direction now feels easier, purposeful.
  He walks with confident strides, his earlier exhaustion replaced by satisfied weariness.
  In his hands, he carefully carries a developed photograph—we can see it clearly, showing
  the glowing mushrooms in their full ethereal beauty, captured perfectly under moonlight. The
  photograph itself seems to glow slightly, as if it carries some of the mushrooms' magic.
  The forest morning is rendered in beautiful detail: mist rising from the streams, dewdrops
  catching the first sunlight, birds beginning their morning songs. Cullan passes landmarks
  from his journey—he walks by where the fox gave him bad advice (the fox sleeps nearby,
  curled in a hollow), he sees the owl's tree (she gives him a knowing nod from her perch),
  he crosses the stream using his discovered path of branches and roots with easy confidence
  now. His camera bounces gently against his chest, and his expression shows deep satisfaction
  mixed with growing excitement to share what he's accomplished. The composition follows him
  through dappled morning light, with the path ahead growing brighter and more welcoming. In
  his pocket, visible corner of Emer's photo and the painted stone he retrieved, both tokens
  of what made success possible. Details include: morning light transforming everything to
  gold and green, small creatures greeting him as he passes (the mice from before, watching
  approvingly), waterfalls catching sunrise colors, and his footprints in the dewey moss
  marking a confident path home. The mood is one of earned triumph and anticipation of
  homecoming—the external goal achieved, but something deeper now pulling him forward.

  As dawn broke, Cullan walked home through the forest, the photograph of the glowing
  mushrooms safely in his hands—more beautiful than he'd even imagined. He couldn't wait
  to show Emer what her painted stone had helped him achieve.
