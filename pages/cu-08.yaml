# Visual description for the illustrator
visual: |
  Cullan sits with his back against an ancient oak tree on the original stream bank, his
  lanky frame slumped in exhaustion and defeat. His camera lies in his lap, temporarily
  forgotten. His blonde hair is disheveled, dirt smudges mark his cheek and clothes, and his
  blue eyes look tired and distant. The light has shifted to deep twilight—the sky above the
  canopy is turning purple and orange, and the forest is filling with shadows. Across the
  stream, the glowing mushrooms pulse more brightly in the gathering darkness, their ethereal
  light seeming to mock his failed attempt. The beautiful scene that started his quest now
  feels unreachable. Around Cullan, the forest continues its evening transformation: fireflies
  are beginning to emerge, nocturnal creatures are stirring, and the waterfalls in the
  distance have become white ribbons in the dimness. His expression captures complete
  emotional exhaustion—not just physical tiredness, but genuine doubt. His hands rest loosely
  on his camera, and his posture suggests someone who's questioning their entire endeavor.
  The composition emphasizes isolation and the weight of disappointment, with Cullan small
  against the massive tree, dwarfed by the forest's indifference to his struggles. Small
  details include: a few leaves falling around him, the last rays of sunlight disappearing
  from the canopy, his camera strap tangled, and in his pocket, visible corner of a photo of
  Emer—a reminder of home and simpler times. The mood is genuinely melancholic, capturing
  that moment when a person questions whether their goal was ever worth pursuing.

  Cullan sat exhausted against the tree as darkness fell, staring at the distant glow across
  the water he couldn't reach. "Maybe it was never worth it," he whispered to himself, too
  tired to care anymore.
