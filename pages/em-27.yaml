  The same sun-dappled clearing from the very beginning - the stream, the moss-covered
  stones, the familiar trees. The composition deliberately echoes page 5, showing the
  same physical space. But everything feels subtly different, transformed by Emer's
  journey. Emer sits on the same flat rock, but her posture shows new confidence -
  she sits taller, more certain of herself. Her painting supplies are spread around
  her, and she's creating, but with a different quality - more free, more joyful,
  less concerned with capturing something and more engaged in the pure act of
  creation. The crystal from the bear sits nearby, catching sunlight and casting tiny
  rainbows. Hansel plays with his blocks nearby, building an elaborate tower. But
  here's the transformation: small rainbow sparkles float naturally around Emer as
  she paints, appearing and disappearing like fireflies, drawn by her creative joy.
  She notices them but doesn't chase them - just smiles and keeps creating. The
  forest creatures are present but closer than before - rabbits sit nearby watching,
  birds perch on low branches, a young deer drinks from the stream - as if Emer's
  journey has deepened her connection to the forest. Everything is rendered in the
  same loving detail as the opening, but there's a quality of magic made ordinary, of
  wonder integrated into daily life.

  Back in her familiar clearing, Emer painted with pure happiness, not trying to make
  magic happen but knowing it was always there. The sparkles came and went like
  friends visiting, and that was perfect.
