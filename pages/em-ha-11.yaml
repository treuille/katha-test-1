  A scene of wonder and accomplishment. Emer and Hansel stand at the base of
  the magnificent waterfall in a hidden clearing. The waterfall creates a pool
  of crystal-clear, luminous water that reflects every color of the rainbow.
  Emer kneels at the pool's edge, dipping her paint water cup into it - the
  cup fills with glowing, rainbow-tinted water. Hansel sits beside her, one
  hand in the water, laughing as the colors swirl around his fingers. The
  clearing is filled with bioluminescent flowers and moss, creating a magical
  sanctuary. Both children are backlit by the waterfall's glow, their
  expressions full of joy and satisfaction. The external goal is achieved -
  they found the source of the stream.

  The waterfall was even more beautiful up close. It created a pool of crystal
  water that shimmered with every color imaginable. Emer filled her paint water
  cup with the magical water. "We can take this home and remember," she told
  Hansel. He clapped his hands in the rainbow water, sending sparkles everywhere.
