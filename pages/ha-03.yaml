visual: |
  In a sun-dappled garden clearing, one-year-old Hansel stands on his wobbly
  legs, arms stretched high overhead, reaching for a beautiful iridescent butterfly
  that dances just out of reach. His face shows pure determination mixed with his
  characteristic bright smile. Around his feet are scattered attempts to reach
  higher - a small wooden block he tried to stand on, a red pyramid knocked over,
  a blue cube rolled to the side. The butterfly floats gracefully above him,
  sunlight making its wings shimmer with rainbow colors. Hansel bounces on his
  toes, his whole body engaged in the effort, but the butterfly stays tantalizingly
  beyond his grasp. Flower petals drift around the scene, and soft grass cushions
  his unsteady stance.

  Hansel jumped and reached for the pretty butterfly, stretching as high as his
  little arms could go. He even tried standing on his blue block, but it rolled
  away and the butterfly danced higher!
