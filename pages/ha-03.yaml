  Deeper into the forest, past where Cullan waved goodbye, one-year-old Hansel
  stands in a small clearing dappled with sunlight filtering through the trees.
  His wobbly legs carry him in excited circles as he reaches high overhead for
  the beautiful iridescent butterfly that dances just out of reach. His face shows
  pure determination mixed with his characteristic bright smile. He tries jumping,
  his whole body engaged in the effort. He tries standing on a fallen log, but
  wobbles and hops down. He even tries using the blue pyramid he still clutches
  to reach higher, holding it up like a tiny tower, but the butterfly floats
  gracefully just beyond his grasp, sunlight making its wings shimmer with rainbow
  colors. The forest around him is growing less familiar - taller trees, deeper
  shadows, wilder flowers. But the butterfly beckons him forward still.

  Hansel chased the butterfly deeper into the forest. He jumped and reached, stretching
  as high as his little arms could go! He tried standing on a log, he tried using his
  blue pyramid to reach higher, but the butterfly just danced away, always just beyond
  his fingers!
