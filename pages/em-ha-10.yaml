  A dramatic, dynamic scene of courage and triumph. Emer is halfway across the
  vine bridge, which sways in a gentle arc over the gap. She carries Hansel
  securely on her back now, his arms wrapped around her neck, his face showing
  trust and excitement rather than fear. Emer's expression is determined and
  focused, her curly hair streaming behind her. One hand grips the vine firmly,
  the other steadies Hansel. Below them is the drop to the glowing stream and
  flower-filled clearing. Ahead is the waterfall's landing, solid and inviting.
  The composition uses a diagonal to emphasize the motion and challenge, with
  the waterfall creating a luminous backdrop. This is the moment of truth, and
  both children are fully committed to reaching their goal.

  Emer tested the vines carefully - they were strong! She lifted Hansel onto
  her back. "Hold on tight!" The vine bridge swayed and bounced as they crossed,
  and Emer's heart raced, but she kept going. Hansel laughed with delight.
  Step by step, they crossed together until finally - finally! - they reached
  the other side.
