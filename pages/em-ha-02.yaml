  Emer kneels beside a beautiful, gently glowing stream that winds through the
  forest. The water shimmers with an otherworldly light, reflecting blues and
  silvers. Hansel stands beside her, one small hand gripping her shoulder as
  he leans forward, his eyes wide with wonder and that signature smile on his
  face. Emer looks up the stream's path, which curves mysteriously around a
  bend ahead. Her expression is excited but protective - one hand reaching back
  to make sure Hansel is safe. The forest around them seems to lean in with
  interest, and small motes of light dance above the water's surface.

  "Look, Hansel!" Emer whispered. A stream of glowing water wound through the forest.
  She had never seen it before. Where did it come from? Where did it go?
  Emer took her brother's hand. "Let's find out together!"
