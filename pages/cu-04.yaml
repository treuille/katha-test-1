# Visual description for the illustrator
visual: |
  In a hollow of an enormous ancient tree, a magnificent great horned owl perches on a gnarled
  branch, its amber eyes wise and knowing. Cullan stands below, looking up with respectful
  attention, his camera still around his neck. The owl's feathers are rendered in extraordinary
  detail—each barred pattern, each tuft carefully drawn. Around them, the forest is growing
  dimmer as afternoon turns to early evening, with shafts of golden light creating dramatic
  shadows. The owl gestures with one wing toward the deeper forest, where the trees grow
  denser and the light doesn't penetrate as easily. Cullan's expression is a mix of hope and
  uncertainty—his gentle nature showing in his respectful posture, but his blue eyes reveal
  a hint of worry about venturing into unfamiliar territory. Small details surround them: a
  family of mice listening from a nearby branch, intricate moss patterns on the tree bark, and
  tiny luminescent beetles beginning to glow as twilight approaches. The composition creates
  a sense of mentorship and wisdom being passed down, while also hinting at the more
  challenging path ahead. The owl's tree hollow is lined with collected treasures—interesting
  stones, feathers, and small objects that speak to long years of forest wisdom.

  "There's an ancient log bridge in the deep forest," the wise owl said, "but the path
  is tangled and few venture there." Cullan thanked her and turned toward the darker,
  unfamiliar woods with determination in his eyes.
