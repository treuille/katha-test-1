# Visual description for the illustrator
visual: |
  In a hollow of an enormous ancient tree, a magnificent great horned owl perches on a gnarled
  branch, its amber eyes wise and knowing. Cullan stands below, looking up with respectful
  attention, his camera still around his neck. The owl's feathers are rendered in extraordinary
  detail—each barred pattern, each tuft carefully drawn. Around them, the forest is growing
  dimmer as afternoon turns to early evening, with shafts of golden light creating dramatic
  shadows. The owl gestures with one wing toward the deeper forest, where the trees grow
  denser and stranger. Cullan's expression shows a mix of hope and slight frustration—he wants
  the answer NOW. The owl's expression is gently amused, as if she knows something he hasn't
  learned yet. Small details surround them: a family of mice listening from a nearby branch,
  intricate moss patterns on the tree bark, and tiny luminescent beetles beginning to glow as
  twilight approaches. The composition creates a sense of mentorship, with the owl offering
  wisdom that Cullan doesn't quite understand yet. The owl's tree hollow is lined with collected
  treasures—interesting stones, feathers, and small objects that speak to long years of forest
  wisdom.

  "The deep forest knows many paths across water," the wise owl said, "but you're searching
  too hard, young one. Sometimes the forest shows you what you need when you stop looking."
  Cullan thanked her but headed deeper into the woods anyway, determined to find his crossing.
