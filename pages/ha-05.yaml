  Deep in the mysterious forest where unfamiliar trees tower overhead and shadows
  dance. One-year-old Hansel toddles along a winding path, his confident smile
  now mixed with uncertainty. Before him stands a sleek red fox with a too-wide
  grin and gleaming eyes that suggest mischief rather than helpfulness. The fox
  gestures dramatically with his paw toward a dark, tangled thicket of thorns and
  brambles, clearly the wrong direction. The beautiful butterfly Hansel has been
  following hovers uncertainly nearby. The forest feels bigger and wilder here -
  mushrooms dot the forest floor, strange flowers bloom in unusual colors, and the
  path forks in multiple confusing directions. Time seems to press as afternoon
  light begins to fade, casting longer shadows.

  A clever-looking fox appeared with a swish of his bushy tail and pointed toward
  the thorny thicket. "That's definitely the way to catch butterflies!" he said
  with a grin that showed too many teeth.
