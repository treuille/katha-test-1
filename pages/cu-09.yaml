# Visual description for the illustrator
visual: |
  Cullan sits up straighter against the tree, his tiredness momentarily forgotten in a flash
  of realization. In his hands, he holds a small photograph—slightly crumpled from being in
  his pocket—showing Emer dancing in their special clearing, her painted stones scattered
  around her feet. The photograph catches the last bit of twilight, and Cullan's face is
  illuminated by wonder and renewed hope. His blue eyes are bright again, focused, and a
  gentle smile plays at his lips. In the corner of the scene, we can see a memory visualization:
  a ghostly overlay showing the clearing from Spread 1, with Emer's colorful painted stones—
  smooth river rocks she decorated with swirling patterns in bright colors. The connection is
  clear on Cullan's face—those stones, flat and stable, could bridge the final gap where the
  branch falls short. The composition shows the transition from despair to hope, with the
  photograph serving as both an emotional anchor (reminding him why beauty matters, why effort
  matters) and a practical solution. The forest around him seems to respond to this shift—the
  fireflies glow a bit brighter, a gentle breeze stirs the leaves, and even the distant
  mushrooms seem to pulse with encouragement. Details include: Cullan's hand unconsciously
  moving to his camera again, the photograph showing not just Emer but the scattered painted
  stones, the tree bark's texture where his back rests, and in the background, the path back
  to their special clearing visible in the moonlight that's beginning to emerge. His expression
  captures that precious moment when discouragement transforms into determination—not because
  he has to succeed, but because he remembers what matters.
