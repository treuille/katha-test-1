# Visual description for the illustrator
visual: |
  Cullan sits up straighter against the tree, his tiredness momentarily forgotten in a flash
  of realization. The rising moonlight illuminates smooth river stones scattered all around
  him on the forest floor—stones worn flat by countless years of water flow, their surfaces
  catching the silvery light. Cullan's face is illuminated by wonder and renewed hope. His
  blue eyes are bright again, focused, and a gentle smile plays at his lips as he reaches
  down to pick up one of the stones, testing its weight and flatness in his palm. The
  connection is clear on Cullan's face—these stones, flat and stable, could bridge the
  final gap where the branch falls short. The composition shows the transition from despair
  to hope, with the simple stones serving as both a reminder that solutions often lie close
  at hand and a practical path forward. The forest around him seems to respond to this
  shift—the fireflies glow a bit brighter, a gentle breeze stirs the leaves, and even the
  distant mushrooms seem to pulse with encouragement. Details include: Cullan's hand
  unconsciously moving to his camera again, several flat stones now gathered beside him,
  the tree bark's texture where his back rests, and in the background, the moonlit path
  back to the stream visible through the trees. His expression captures that precious
  moment when discouragement transforms into determination—not because he has to succeed,
  but because he's learned to see what the forest has been offering all along.
