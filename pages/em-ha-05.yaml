beat: "Attempt #3 (bigger world / stakes up)"
hook: Questionable character offers confident solution, creating doubt about whether to trust them.
payoff: The suggested solution fails spectacularly and obviously wrong.

description: A mischievous squirrel offers to show them a "shortcut" through the trees, but it leads to a wobbly branch that bounces them around comically before they retreat.

  High in the canopy of The Hidden Forest, a cheeky-looking squirrel with a
  too-confident grin points energetically down a branch. Emer and Hansel are
  partway along the indicated branch, which is clearly too thin and bouncy.
  The branch is bending dramatically under their weight, sending them bouncing
  up and down. Hansel is laughing delightedly at the bouncing, his arms spread
  wide, while Emer holds him tight with one arm and grips the branch with the
  other, her expression caught between anxiety and the urge to laugh. Below
  them is a dizzying drop to the forest floor, with the glowing stream visible
  far in the wrong direction. The squirrel looks overly pleased with itself.

  "Follow me! I know a super-fast way!" chattered a bushy-tailed squirrel.
  But his "shortcut" led to a thin, bouncy branch that sent them wobbling and
  bouncing wildly. Hansel giggled with delight, but Emer held him tight. "This
  isn't the right way!" she called out as they carefully backed up to safety.
