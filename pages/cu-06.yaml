# Visual description for the illustrator
visual: |
  Cullan sits on a moss-covered boulder near the stream, his camera temporarily forgotten in
  his lap, his expression thoughtful and observant. He's consciously applying what he learned
  from watching Emer: instead of desperately searching, he's simply observing what the forest
  shows him. A gentle smile plays on his lips as he thinks of his sister following her sparkles.
  And there, in the middle distance, small creatures are crossing the stream: a family of field
  mice scampering along a low-hanging willow branch that dips close to the water's surface,
  then leaping to an exposed root system, then to another branch. A bright blue jay follows
  the same path, hopping from branch to root to branch. The pattern is clear once you see it—
  nature has created its own highway, low and close to the water, using the living structures
  of trees rather than dead stepping stones. Cullan's blue eyes are bright with understanding,
  his gentle smile widening as he pieces together the solution. His hand is reaching for his
  camera, ready to document what he's learned. The scene is filled with carefully observed
  detail: water droplets catching light on leaves, tiny paw prints on bark, the intricate weave
  of root systems. The composition emphasizes the contrast between Cullan's stillness (like
  watching Emer paint) and the busy, confident movement of the small creatures who know the
  forest's secrets. In the background, the glowing mushrooms are still visible across the
  stream—the goal still waiting, but now seeming achievable. The light has a quality that
  suggests he's been sitting here a while, patient rather than frantic.

  Remembering how life was drawn to Emer's joy, Cullan sat still and watched where life
  moved freely. The mice and birds showed him their crossing—low branches and roots he'd
  missed in his desperate searching. "The forest has its own paths," he whispered, finally
  understanding the owl's words.
