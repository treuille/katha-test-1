# Visual description for the illustrator
visual: |
  Cullan sits on a moss-covered boulder near the stream, his camera temporarily forgotten in
  his lap, his expression thoughtful and observant. The chaos of the failed fox's route is
  behind him—a tangle of broken branches and disturbed undergrowth. But here, in this quiet
  moment, he's watching something important. In the middle distance, small creatures are
  crossing the stream: a family of field mice scampering along a low-hanging willow branch
  that dips close to the water's surface, then leaping to an exposed root system, then to
  another branch. A bright blue jay follows the same path, hopping from branch to root to
  branch. The pattern is clear once you see it—nature has created its own highway, low and
  close to the water, using the living structures of trees rather than dead stepping stones.
  Sunlight breaks through the canopy here, illuminating the crossing points like a revelation.
  Cullan's blue eyes are bright with understanding, his gentle smile returning as he pieces
  together the solution. His hand is reaching for his camera, ready to document what he's
  learned. The scene is filled with carefully observed detail: water droplets catching light
  on leaves, tiny paw prints on bark, the intricate weave of root systems. The composition
  emphasizes the contrast between Cullan's stillness and the busy, confident movement of the
  small creatures who know the forest's secrets. In the background, the glowing mushrooms are
  still visible across the stream—the goal still waiting, but now seeming more achievable.

  Cullan sat still and watched the mice and birds cross the stream using low branches and
  exposed roots, never touching the slippery stones at all. "The forest has its own paths,"
  he whispered, finally understanding.
