  As the sun begins to set, Emer and Hansel walk back through the forest together,
  hand in hand. Behind them, the clearing where they played is still glowing with
  sparkles. But now, a few sparkles follow them too, drifting along as natural
  companions rather than mysterious goals to chase. Emer carries her paintings and
  Hansel carries his blocks, both children tired but deeply happy. The forest path
  ahead leads back toward familiar territory - we can see hints of the clearing
  where Cullan waits in the distance. Emer's expression shows peaceful understanding
  and contentment; she's learned something valuable. The illustration deliberately
  echoes the opening pages but with a transformed quality - Emer walks with more
  confidence, the forest feels more like a friend, and the sparkles are simply part
  of the beauty around her rather than something separate to pursue. Small forest
  creatures wave goodbye from various spots. The light is golden and warm, suggesting
  both an ending and a new beginning. Everything is rendered in loving detail, with
  the sparkles providing gentle light that suggests magic is always present when you
  carry joy and creativity in your heart.

  Walking home with Hansel, Emer realized she'd been chasing something she already
  had - the magic was in her painting, her dancing, and sharing joy with the people
  she loved.
