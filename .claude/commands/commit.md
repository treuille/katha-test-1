Analyze the current git changes and help me commit them.

Current status:
!`git status`

Changes to be committed:
!`git diff --cached`

Unstaged changes:
!`git diff`

Please:
1. Show me what files are staged vs unstaged
2. If there are unstaged changes, ask which files to add
3. Analyze the staged changes and suggest a descriptive commit message
4. Ask if I want to use your suggested message or provide my own
5. Commit with the approved message
6. Show what was committed

IMPORTANT: Do not include any references to AI tools or co-authorship in commit messages.
