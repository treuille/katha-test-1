Analyze the current git changes and help me commit them.

Current status:
!`git status`

Changes to be committed:
!`git diff --cached`

Unstaged changes:
!`git diff`

Please:
1. Show me clearly what files are staged vs unstaged
2. If there are unstaged changes, ask me which files to add:
   - Add all unstaged files
   - Add specific files (let me specify which ones)
   - Commit only what's already staged
3. After staging is finalized, analyze ALL the staged changes and suggest a single-line commit message that follows best practices. The commit message MUST be a single line with no additional text, references to AI tools, or co-authorship tags.
4. Ask me if I want to use your suggested message or provide my own
5. Once I approve, commit the staged changes with the final message using a simple single-line format
6. Show me a summary of what was committed
