# Reference Image Folder

This is where you put reference images as follows:

- `cu-1.jpe`: First reference image for Cullan
- `cu-2.jpe`: Second reference image for Cullan, etc.
- `em-1.jpe`: First reference image for Emer
- `world-1.jpe`: First reference image for the world
- `world-2.jpg`: Second reference image for the world, etc.

To understand better the two digit codes for characters see the [README.md](README.md).
