# Reference Image Folder

This is where you put reference images as follows:

- `cu-1.jpg`: First reference image for Cullan
- `cu-2.jpg`: Second reference image for Cullan, etc.
- `em-1.jpg`: First reference image for Emer
- `style-1.jpg`: First style reference image
- `style-2.jpg`: Second style reference image, etc.

To understand the two-letter character codes, see the [README.md](../README.md).
